## Technologies used

This website is developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript programming languages. Gitpod, Github and git.

## Features

 - The pioneers contain three pages,namely 'HOME', 'PIONEERS' and 'SUBSCRIBE'.

 - The HOME page contains the hero header, navigation bar, images, quick facts, biography and at the very bottom of the web page links to social media.  

### Existing Features

- __The hero header__
    -  At the top of the website, there is an oversized banner containing the logo of the website - 'The pioneers' and the logo slogan -'Get motivated'. Its purpose is to convey the site's overall purpose for the users.

- __Navigation Bar__

    - The navigation bar is designed horizontally and placed in the center on the top of the page.
It contains the links to 'HOME', 'PIONEERS' and 'SUBSCRIBE'. 

1. HOME

    - The home links take the user to the site's home address. 
It is repeated on the subscribe page as well to allow the user to easily return to the home page without clicking the 'back' button. 

2. LIST OF PIONEERS

    - The 'list of pioneers' link is a clickable dropdown menu. The lists inside will be shown to the user when the button is clicked. 
    - This menu allows the user to choose one value at a time. 
    - With the dropdown menu, users are not expected to scroll down to reach the section they want. This helps to narrow user choices and save screen spaces. 

3. SUBSCRIBE

    - The subscribe page is where the user fills out the subscription form. 
    - The form takes the full name and email address from the user. 
    - The primary purpose of this page is to enable the user to receive inspirational and motivational stories from 'The Pioneers' via email.

- __Images__

    - The Home page contains two portrait images. The images are included to catch users attention and to present the inventors.

    - This section highlights different facts about the pioneer presented. This will help the reader to quickly grasp the facts.

    - This section provides basic information about the pioneer's life. The reader discovers fascinating stories about their favorite icons here. 

- __The footer__

   - The footer section, placed at the bottom of the page, has links to social media. All of the links will open to a new tab so that the user stays on the website without distraction.

   - This section is where visitors should go when they have a question and want to contact a specific individual in the organization. 

## Features left to implement

   - Currently the site contains the biography of two persons. In the future it aims to include the biography and inventions of all inventors.

   -  To facilitate the search process a search engine that takes input from the user should be included.


## Testing

  - The page is tested and it works well on different browsers like chrome, safari and internet explorer.

  - The page is responsive and maintains its integrity when viewed on different size screens. The page looks and works the same on different browsers and screen sizes.

  - The homepage link in the navigation menu, takes the user to the home page if the user is on the subscribe page. 

  - The clickable dropdown menu functions well, and when the user clicks the name of the pioneer the page jumps to that specific section.

  - The subscribe page takes name, email and password. The user cannot submit without filling out its full name and email address.

  - The footer contains social media links and as it is intended all open in a new tab when clicked.
